#HomeWork 1 (Predict the Outcome of 2012 US presidential Race in all 50 states)

Task was to correctly predict the outcome of the 2012 presidential race in all 50 states.

1.First I built some tools to download historical polling data from the realclearpolitics and parse it into a more convenient format. 

2.Then I used these tools to aggregate and visualize several past Governor races.
3.Then I ran a bootstrap analysis to estimate the probable outcome of current Governor races, given the level of precision of historical polls.

Library Used:-
Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Python, Scipy,Numpy,pandas
